🌠 Generate "alien signals" based on math models (e.g., fractals, prime sequences, chaotic systems)

🎙️ Attempt to "decode" them using AI techniques (unsupervised learning, autoencoders, clustering)

🧬 Build a signal interpretation layer that maps patterns to potential meanings (based on entropy, frequency, and structural complexity)

🌌 Visualize the decoded signals in a 4D projection (quaternions + time)

numpy, scipy for signal processing

tensorflow or pytorch for model building

quaternion or sympy for complex math

matplotlib + plotly for 3D/4D visualizations

Optional: Integrate with SDR hardware (Software-Defined Radio) to capture real signals from space for fun analysis
